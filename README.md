## About the code in this repository

* it's work in progress with more comments and notes to be added
* the code uses minimal dependencies, in order to facilitate learning and ensure longevity
* notebooks are designed to run from the src directory
* notebooks called chxx.ipynb can be used for experimentation
* notebooks called chxx_output.ipynb show the output of notebooks called chxx.ipynb after being run
* the code behind notebooks is built incrementally in each chapter following sound dependency management principles
* the notebooks only use code dependencies in the chapter they belong to
* there will be a simulator, called Hume, that will put together all pieces, and will be usable as a standalone simulator
