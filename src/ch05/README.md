# Quantum Fourier transform

### Practitioner insights

* Geometric sequence states are the equivalent of single-frequency signals (complex sinusoids) in digital signal processing
* The inverse quantum Fourier transform of a geometric sequence state is a state that show up over and over in quantum computing 
* The magnitudes of this state match the (normalized) values of the discrete sinc function
